    "1. OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    " - object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.\n",
    " - it provides concepts such as objects, classes, inheritance etc.\n",

    "Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   OOP is faster and easier to execute\n",
    "-   OOP provides a clear structure for the programs\n",
    "-   OOP helps to keep the C# code DRY \"Don't Repeat Yourself\", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug\n",
    "-   OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time\n",

    "Object-Oriented Programming offers several benefits, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Modularity**: OOP promotes modularity by breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable parts (objects). This makes it easier to maintain and update the code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Reusability**: OOP allows you to reuse existing code by creating new objects based on existing ones. This saves time and effort in developing new applications.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Flexibility**: OOP provides flexibility in designing and implementing software systems. You can easily modify and extend the functionality of objects without affecting other parts of the system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   **Scalability**: OOP supports scalability by allowing you to add new objects and classes as the system grows. This makes it easier to accommodate changes and enhancements in the software."
