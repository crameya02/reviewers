    "    \n",

    "    -   **Using `kill -3 <pid>`** (Linux): Sends a SIGQUIT signal to the JVM, generating a thread dump to the standard output (stdout).\n",
    "    -   **Using IDEs**: Some IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse can capture thread dumps directly.\n",
    "-   **Key Elements of a Thread Dump**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.  **Thread State**: Indicates whether a thread is running, waiting, sleeping, or blocked.\n",

    "    2.  **Stack Traces**: Each thread shows the method calls it’s currently executing.\n",
    "    3.  **Locks**: Identify if a thread is holding or waiting for locks (useful for deadlock analysis).\n",
    "    4.  **Thread Names**: Can indicate thread role (e.g., \"main\", \"GC\", \"worker threads\").\n",
    "-   **Common Issues in Thread Dumps**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.  **Deadlocks**: When two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other’s resources.\n",
    "        -   Can be identified by looking for threads that are waiting on locks held by each other.\n",
    "    2.  **High CPU Utilization**: Long-running threads or infinite loops can be detected by analyzing the thread states.\n",
    "    3.  **Thread Blocking**: Threads stuck in `WAITING` or `BLOCKED` states, indicating a synchronization issue or resource contention.\n",
    "-   **Troubleshooting Steps**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.  **Identify Thread States**: Check if any thread is in `BLOCKED` or `WAITING` state.\n",
    "    2.  **Check Stack Traces**: Look for the exact code causing issues. Long or infinite loops are often the culprit.\n",
    "    3.  **Find Deadlocks**: Look for `locked` sections and verify if threads are waiting for resources that cannot be released.\n",
    "    4.  **Investigate Resource Contention**: Multiple threads trying to access the same resource at the same time might need optimizations in synchronization.\n",
    "-   **Tools for Analyzing Thread Dumps**:\n",

    "    -   **Thread Dump Analyzer**: Tools like FastThread, Thread Dump Analyzer can automate the process of parsing and analyzing thread dumps.\n",
