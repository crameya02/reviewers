    "B. Types of Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "    Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "        Popular linear data structures are:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. Array Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "        - elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. All the elements of an array are of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "        b. Stack Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "        - elements are stored in the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. That is, the last element stored in a stack will be removed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        c. Queue Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "        - the queue data structure works in the First In, First Out FIFO principle where first element stored in the queue will be removed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "        d. Linked List Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "        - data elements are connected through a series of nodes. And, each node contains the data items and address to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-linear data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. Graph Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "        - In graph data structure, each node is called vertex and each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges.\n",

    "\n",
    "        - Similar to a graph, a tree is also a collection of vertices and edges. However, in tree data structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices.\n",
