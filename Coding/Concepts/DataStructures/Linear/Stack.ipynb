    "\n",
    "Expression Evaluation: In compilers or interpreters, stacks are used to evaluate arithmetic expressions (e.g., postfix notation). Peek helps in evaluating operators or operands at the top of the stack without modifying it.\n",

    "Application State Management: Stacks can store application states or user actions. Peek can be used to preview the last action or state change without actually applying it.\n",

    "Text Editors and IDEs: Implementing undo and redo functionalities often involves using stacks to store changes or commands. Peek allows users to preview the next action to be undone or redone.\n",

    "Task Scheduling: Stacks can be used to manage task scheduling in concurrent programming. Peek can help in inspecting pending tasks or threads without executing them.\n",
